## Supervisor Meeting (Tue, 16 Mar @4.30pm)

#### Attendance

- Fei
- My Tien
- Nico
- Paul

#### Minutes

- Going through admin tasks (confirming supervisor access to Trello board and Github repo)
- Feedback on Trello page:
  - separate columns for different sprints (recommended) OR colour-coding (currently used)
  - separate huge tasks into several smaller, more modular tasks (particularly "Confluence Specification Page")
- Preparation for client meeting/interaction:
  - requirements elicitation may be challenging if the client is unsure/is very conceptual
  - suggestion:
    - run through a "requirements workshop" session with the client
    - prepare a few ideas for the client and validate them (have to be creative in idea generation)
  - since client is not on Slack yet, email may be the best communication method for now
